* Introduction

  Genibot is a Twitter bot that allows anyone create amazing art.  It
  interfaces with a job queue, a message queue, and a storage service
  to send jobs, get notified when the jobs are processed, and download
  the final results--in that order.

* Development

** Setup

   We use [[https://python-poetry.org/][Poetry]] for Python dependency management.

** Testing

   To run tests on file changes, we use [[https://eradman.com/entrproject/][entr]].
